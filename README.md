# Odin Recipes - A Simple Recipe Website

This is my first project from the Odin Project, where I created a simple recipe website featuring three recipes: Lasagna, Mushroom Risotto, and Chicken Parmigiana. The goal was to practice basic HTML and use Git for version control.

## Project Overview

The website contains three pages, each dedicated to one of the recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients, instructions, and images to provide a clear and easy-to-follow guide for preparing the dishes.

## Recipes Featured

- **Lasagna**: A classic Italian dish with layers of pasta, cheese, meat sauce, and herbs.
- **Mushroom Risotto**: A creamy, savory rice dish with fresh mushrooms and parmesan.
- **Chicken Parmigiana**: Breaded chicken cutlets topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (Basic structure, lists, links, images)
- Git (Version control and GitHub for code hosting)
